# A Vote for moving slog-global to tikv org

## Proposal

TiKV heavily relies on slog-global to print logs without a explicit scope. As we do not have plans
to change this pattern, I propose to move the slog-global from a personally maintained repository
https://github.com/breezewish/slog-global into the tikv org. In this way, the repository can be
officially maintained by the TiKV community.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Result

Pending
