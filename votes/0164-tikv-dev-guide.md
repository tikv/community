# A Vote for Accept TiKV Dev Guide Repo

## Proposal

[Proposal: TiKV Development Guide](https://internals.tidb.io/t/topic/277) was posted at 2021-07-21, and during the last half year we finished several chapter of the guide at [tisonkun/tikv-dev-guide](https://github.com/tisonkun/tikv-dev-guide).

However, there're still 36 outstanding issues and thus at least 36 sections to be written. After a discussion with @zz-jason, he proposed that we can transfer the dev guide to tikv org and proceed the work.

I'm glad to see any pull requests to fulfill new sections. If transferring the repo to tikv org can help moving forward the progress, I'm willing to do so.

So here is the vote thread about transferring [tisonkun/tikv-dev-guide](https://github.com/tisonkun/tikv-dev-guide) to tikv org.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 72 hours unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Result
