# Coprocessor SIG Charter

This charter follows the TiKV Community Charter, using the role definitions and responsibilities in [SIG Governance](/GOVERNANCE.md).

## Scope

Coprocessor SIG focuses on the Coprocessor module of the TiKV project, which is the module in TiKV that handles TiDB's pushdown calculations. The primary responsibility of this SIG is to discuss, plan, develop, and maintain the future development of the Coprocessor module. Only Active Contributors or higher-level community members can become members of the SIG and participate in SIG activities. However, the decisions and projects undertaken by the Coprocessor SIG will be made public.

## Routine Work

- Code
  - Framework: Framework improvements, including expression calculation frameworks, executor execution frameworks, etc.
  - Executor: Improve existing executors and collaborate with TiDB to develop new executors.
  - Function: Maintain an existing or port a new built-in function / aggregate function implementation from TiDB.
  - Location: [tidb_query](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/tree/master/components/tidb_query).

- Test
  - The code needs to pass existing integration tests, and new changes need to be added to [copr-test](https://github.com/tikv/copr-test) to add new integration tests.
  - The function ported from the TiDB needs unit tests.
  - Expression's integration test requires a test that uses this expression.

- Design proposals
- Review code

## Other

- For code style, submission specification, PR description template, etc, please refer to [Documentation](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- Task Assignment
  - SIG Tech Lead maintains a public [Member List](https://tikv.github.io/members/build/index.html?name=coprocessor) and [Task List](./workflow-zh_CN.md) at https://github.com/tikv/community.
  - New SIG members have 2 weeks to learn about tasks and claim a task, or participate in the development of an existing task. If the task is not claimed within this time, the member will be removed from SIG.
  - SIG members are required to engage development each month, or participate in the design or discussion of existing features or future design. If a member does not participate in code development or future discussion for one quarter, he / she will be considered inactive and will be removed from the SIG. However as an acknowledgment, the name will be stay in the "Former Member" of the member list.

- Regularly synchronize
  - Synchronize the development progress of current projects every 2 weeks.
  - A full group progress meeting will be held every 2 weeks, depending on the available time of the participants. Members who are currently not developing a project are also eligible to participate in order to know the progress of each project. If members are unable to participate, he / she must apply for leave in advance and update the progress document.
  - A meeting is recorded by one member each time. Meeting notes are completed and made public within 24 hours of the end of the meeting. The meeting notes are recorded by the team members in turn.
