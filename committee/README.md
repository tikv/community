# PMC

PMC (Project Management Committee) functions as the core management team that oversees the TiKV community. The PMC has additional responsibilities over and above those of a committer. These responsibilities ensure the smooth running of the project. PMC members are expected to review code contributions, participate in strategic planning, approve changes to the governance model and manage the copyrights within the project outputs. See [Governance](/governance.md#project-management-committee) for more details about PMC.

## Members

Membership of the PMC is by invitation from the existing PMC members. For the first formation of the committee our maintainers nominated a group of people who had great impact or influence on the project, including some members from PingCAP who founded TiKV.

The current PMC members are:

- Max Liu(**[@goroutine](https://github.com/ngaut/)**)
- Ed Huang(**[@c4pt0r](https://github.com/c4pt0r)**)
- Dylan Cui(**[@qiuyesuifeng](https://github.com/qiuyesuifeng)**)
- Li Shen(**[@shenli](https://github.com/shenli)**)
- Siddon Tang(**[@siddontang](https://github.com/siddontang)**)
- Wink Yao(**[@winkyao](https://github.com/winkyao)**)
