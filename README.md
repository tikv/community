## TiKV Community

Welcome to the TiKV Community! The main objective is to help members of the TiKV community who share similar interests to learn from and collaborate with each other.

Your journey of becoming a contributor and committer starts from here: improving docs, improving code, giving talks, organizing meetups, etc.

## Governance

TiKV has the following types of groups that are officially supported:

+ PMC (Project Management Committee) is to manage and oversee the entire TiKV community. The PMC consists of Core Maintainers and Organizer Committee Chair. 
+ Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are persistent open groups that focus on a part of the project. SIGs must have open and transparent proceedings. Anyone is welcome to participate and contribute provided they follow the [TiKV Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The purpose of a SIG is to own and develop a set of TiKV subprojects or components. See more details in SIG governance([中文](/committee/sig-governance/SIG-GOVERNANCE-zh_CN.md), [English](/committee/sig-governance/SIG-GOVERNANCE.md))
+ Working Groups are temporary groups that are formed to address issues that cross SIG boundaries. Working groups do not own any code or other long term artifacts. Working groups can report back and act through involved SIGs. See more details in WG governance([中文](/committee/wg-governance/wg-governance-zh_CN.md), [English](committee/wg-governance/wg-governance.md))

See the full governance([中文](/GOVERNANCE-zh_CN.md), [English](/GOVERNANCE.md)) for more details on these groups.

## How Do I Become a Committer?

First of all you need to get involved and be a Contributor.

Based on your track-record as a contributor, one of our Maintainers or PMC members may invite you to be a committer (after we've called a vote). When that happens, if you accept, the following process kicks into place...

Note that becoming a committer is not just about submitting some patches; it's also about helping out on the development and helping with documentation and the issues.

See [How to be a TiKV Contributor.md](https://tikv.org/docs/3.0/contribute/contribute-to-tikv/) for more details.

## Communication

Communication within the TiKV community abides by [TiKV Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Here is an excerpt:
