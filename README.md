## How Do I Become a Committer?

First of all you need to get involved and be a Contributor.

Based on your track-record as a contributor, one of our Maintainers or PMC members may invite you to be a committer (after we've called a vote). When that happens, if you accept, the following process kicks into place...

Note that becoming a committer is not just about submitting some patches; it's also about helping out on the development and helping with documentation and the issues.

See [How to be a TiKV Contributor.md](https://tikv.org/docs/3.0/contribute/contribute-to-tikv/) for more details.
